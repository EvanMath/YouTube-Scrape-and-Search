# YouTube-Scrape-and-Search
This repo started as a try of helping a friend. The main goal was to scrape YouTube for a specific region and category, create a dataset and do some analysis. Ultimately the result was to create a searcher-scraper script for YouTube with multiple way to work it. For sure it can be much more improved and hope you help improve it as it is also my first work that it is public.

# First things first
You have to create a YouTube Data API v3 key and copy it inside the <em>api_key.txt</em>. If you don't the program will fail run. 

Moreover, there are some default values for region code and language parameters. To choose the region code you want to use you can take a look <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes>here.
